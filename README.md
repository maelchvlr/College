# College
This repository is a collection of everything I thought was important in what I did during my three years of college outside of the big projects which are available on the main page, such as the American Sign Language recognition AI, the guess who (using Object Oriented Programming), and the first website I made using basic concepts of SQL, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.
