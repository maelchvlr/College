# College
This repository is a collection of everything I thought was important in what I did during my three years of college outside of the big projects which are available on my profile, such as the American Sign Language recognition AI, the guess who (using Object Oriented Programming), and the first website I made using basic concepts of SQL, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. Some of this project might show someone else than me as the main contributor, this is due to technical difficulties but I did not steal any content and participated in every project shown in this folder and on my profile overall.

In the course of those three years, I also worked on theorical subjects, such as syntaxical analysis, algorithm complexity and calculability, models of computation, first order logic and process architecture, which are hard to present as code, but I'll leave some examples of more theorical productions in the "others" folder.

I also took linear algebra a and arithmetic classes, I worked with vector and matrices and learned how to go back to the very first mathematical concepts and prove them to be able to understand higher level mathematics in a deeper way.

It cannot be found on this github, but I worked on software engineering, using external tools to improve our apps (dockers, snyk, sonarcloud...) and understanding the concept of software engineering. Everything can be found at this gitlab adress : https://gitlab.com/comptegithubfac/term1
