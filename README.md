# College
This repository is a collection of everything I thought was important in what I did during my three years of college outside of the big projects which are available on my profile, such as the American Sign Language recognition AI, the guess who (using Object Oriented Programming), and the first website I made using basic concepts of SQL, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.

In the course of those three years, I also worked on theorical subjects, such as syntaxical analysis, algorithm complexity and calculability, models of computation, first order logic and process architecture, which are hard to present as code, but I'll leave some examples of more theorical productions in the "others" folder.
